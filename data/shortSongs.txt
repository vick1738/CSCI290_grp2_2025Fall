TITLE="Pop Goes The Weasel"
LYRICS="All around the mulberry bush
The monkey chased the weasel.
The monkey thought 'twas all in good fun
Pop! goes the weasel

A penny for a spool of thread,
A penny for a needle-
That's the way the money goes,
Pop! goes the weasel

Jimmy's got the whooping cough
And Timmy's got the measles.
That's the way the story goes,
Pop! goes the weasel

When the wind blows your cradle will rock
When the bow breaks your cradle will fall
Down will come baby cradle and all
